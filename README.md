A VR port of the Kenny Jam 2021 submission, Pirate  Jam, by Julia Melgar√© and Diogo Muller. [Check out the original game's repo here!](https://github.com/Julia-Melgare/PirateJam).
This port was made for college project, with the permission of the original authors, using the Unity engine.

The intended use is for the Oculus Quest 2. It can be built into the system via Unity, and then be played anywhere, using the Quest 2's portable features.
However, it also should be able to run on any other PC VR headset.
